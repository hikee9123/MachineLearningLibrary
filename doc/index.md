# Documentation for mlpack

## A fast, flexible machine learning library

mlpack is an intuitive, fast, and flexible header-only C++ machine learning
library with bindings to other languages.  It aims to provide fast, lightweight
implementations of both common and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms.

mlpack's lightweight C++ implementation makes it ideal for deployment, and it
can also be used for interactive prototyping via C++ notebooks (these can be
seen in action on mlpack's [homepage](https://www.mlpack.org/)).

In addition to its [powerful C++ interface](quickstart/cpp.md), mlpack also
provides [command-line programs](quickstart/cli.md), and bindings to the
[Python](quickstart/python.md), [R](quickstart/r.md),
[Julia](quickstart/julia.md), and [Go](quickstart/go.md) languages.

_If you use mlpack, please [cite the software](citation.md)._

## mlpack basics

Installing mlpack can be done using the
[instructions in the README](README.md#3-installing-and-using-mlpack-in-c);
or the [Windows build guide](user/build_windows.md).
The following basic guides are *highly recommended* before using mlpack.

 * ***First steps***:
   - [mlpack C++ quickstart](quickstart/cpp.md): create a couple simple C++
     programs that use mlpack
   - [Sample Windows mlpack C++ application](user/sample_ml_app.md): create a
     working mlpack Windows program using Visual Studio

 * ***Basics of matrices and data in mlpack***:
   - [Matrices and data in mlpack](user/matrices.md)
   - [Loading and saving mlpack objects](user/load_save.md)

 * ***Reference for mlpack core classes***:
   - [Core mlpack documentation](user/core.md)

 * ***Using mlpack natively with our extensions in Python, R, CLI, Julia, and Go***:
   - [Links to quickstarts and references](#bindings-to-other-languages)

## mlpack algorithm documentation

Documentation for each machine learning algorithm that mlpack implements is
detailed in the sections below.

 * [Classification algorithms](#classification-algorithms): classify points as
   discrete labels (`0`, `1`, `2`, ...).
 * [Regression algorithms](#regression-algorithms): predict continuous values.
 * [Clustering algorithms](#clustering-algorithms): group points into clusters.
 * [Geometric algorithms](#geometric-algorithms): computations based on distance
   metrics (nearest neighbors, kernel density estimation, etc.).
 * [Preprocessing utilities](#preprocessing-utilities): prepare data for machine
   learning algorithms.
 * [Transformations](#transformations): transform data from one space to
   another (principal components analysis, etc.).
 * [Modeling utilities](#modeling-utilities): cross-validation, hyperparameter
   tuning, etc.

## Bindings to other languages

mlpack's bindings to other languages have less complete functionality than
mlpack in C++, but almost all the same algorithms are available.

## Examples and further documentation

 * [mlpack examples repository](https://github.com/mlpack/examples/): numerous
   fully-working example applications of mlpack, in C++ and other languages.
 * [mlpack models repository](https://github.com/mlpack/models/): complex models
   in C++ built with mlpack

For additional documentation beyond what is covered in all the resources above,
the source code should be consulted.  Each method is fully documented.

## Developer documentation

Throughout the codebase, mlpack uses some common template parameter policies.
These are documented below.

 * [The `ElemType` policy](developer/elemtype.md): element types for data
 * [The `MetricType` policy](developer/metrics.md): distance metrics
 * [The `KernelType` policy](developer/kernels.md): kernel functions
 * [The `TreeType` policy](developer/trees.md): space trees (ball trees,
   KD-trees, etc.)

In addition, the following documentation may be useful when developing bindings
for other languages:

 * [Writing an mlpack binding](developer/iodoc.md): simple examples of mlpack
   bindings
 * [Automatic bindings](developer/bindings.md): details on mlpack's automatic
   binding generator system.
