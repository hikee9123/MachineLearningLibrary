.SH "mlpack versions in code"
.PP
mlpack provides a couple of convenience macros and functions to get the version of mlpack\&. More information (and straightforward code) can be found in \fBsrc/mlpack/core/util/version\&.hpp\fP\&.
.PP
The following three macros provide major, minor, and patch versions of mlpack (i\&.e\&. for mlpack-x\&.y\&.z, 'x' is the major version, 'y' is the minor version, and 'z' is the patch version):

.PP
.nf
MLPACK_VERSION_MAJOR
MLPACK_VERSION_MINOR
MLPACK_VERSION_PATCH

In addition, the function \fC\fBmlpack::util::GetVersion()\fP\fP returns the mlpack version as a string (for instance, 'mlpack 1\&.0\&.8')\&.
.SH "mlpack executable versions"
.PP
Each mlpack executable supports the \fC--version\fP (or \fC-V\fP ) option, which will print the version of mlpack used\&. If the version is not an official release but instead from svn trunk, the version will be 'mlpack trunk' (and may have a revision number appended to 'trunk')\&.
