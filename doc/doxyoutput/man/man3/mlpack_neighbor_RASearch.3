The \fBRASearch\fP class: This class provides a generic manner to perform rank-approximate search via random-sampling\&. 

If the 'naive' option is chosen, this rank-approximate search will be done by randomly sampling from the whole set\&. If the 'naive' option is not chosen, the sampling is done in a stratified manner in the tree as mentioned in the algorithms in Figure 2 of the following paper:

.SS "\fBRASearch\fP (MatType referenceSet, const bool naive = \fCfalse\fP, const bool singleMode = \fCfalse\fP, const double tau = \fC5\fP, const double alpha = \fC0\&.95\fP, const bool sampleAtLeaves = \fCfalse\fP, const bool firstLeafExact = \fCfalse\fP, const size_t singleSampleLimit = \fC20\fP, const MetricType metric = \fCMetricType()\fP)"

.PP
Initialize the \fBRASearch\fP object, passing both a reference dataset (this is the dataset that will be searched)\&. Optionally, perform the computation in naive mode or single-tree mode\&. An initialized distance metric can be given, for cases where the metric has internal data (i\&.e\&. the distance::MahalanobisDistance class)\&.
.PP
This method will copy the matrices to internal copies, which are rearranged during tree-building\&. If you don't need to keep the reference dataset, you can use std::move() to remove the overhead of making copies\&. Using std::move() transfers the ownership of the dataset\&.
.PP
tau, the rank-approximation parameter, specifies that we are looking for k neighbors with probability alpha of being in the top tau percent of nearest neighbors\&. So, as an example, if our dataset has 1000 points, and we want 5 nearest neighbors with 95% probability of being in the top 5% of nearest neighbors (or, the top 50 nearest neighbors), we set k = 5, tau = 5, and alpha = 0\&.95\&.
.PP
The method will fail (and throw a std::invalid_argument exception) if the value of tau is too low: tau must be set such that the number of points in the corresponding percentile of the data is greater than k\&. Thus, if we choose tau = 0\&.1 with a dataset of 1000 points and k = 5, then we are attempting to choose 5 nearest neighbors out of the closest 1 point -- this is invalid\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIreferenceSet\fP Set of reference points\&. 
.br
\fInaive\fP If true, the rank-approximate search will be performed by directly sampling the whole set instead of using the stratified sampling on the tree\&. 
.br
\fIsingleMode\fP If true, single-tree search will be used (as opposed to dual-tree search)\&. This is useful when \fBSearch()\fP will be called with few query points\&. 
.br
\fImetric\fP An optional instance of the MetricType class\&. 
.br
\fItau\fP The rank-approximation in percentile of the data\&. The default value is 5%\&. 
.br
\fIalpha\fP The desired success probability\&. The default value is 0\&.95\&. 
.br
\fIsampleAtLeaves\fP Sample at leaves for faster but less accurate computation\&. This defaults to 'false'\&. 
.br
\fIfirstLeafExact\fP Traverse to the first leaf without approximation\&. This can ensure that the query definitely finds its (near) duplicate if there exists one\&. This defaults to 'false' for now\&. 
.br
\fIsingleSampleLimit\fP The limit on the largest node that can be approximated by sampling\&. This defaults to 20\&.

.PP
Initialize the \fBRASearch\fP object with the given pre-constructed reference tree\&. It is assumed that the points in the tree's dataset correspond to the reference set\&. Optionally, choose to use single-tree mode\&. Naive mode is not available as an option for this constructor; instead, to run naive computation, use a different constructor\&. Additionally, an instantiated distance metric can be given, for cases where the distance metric holds data\&.
.PP
There is no copying of the data matrices in this constructor (because tree-building is not necessary), so this is the constructor to use when copies absolutely must be avoided\&.
.PP
tau, the rank-approximation parameter, specifies that we are looking for k neighbors with probability alpha of being in the top tau percent of nearest neighbors\&. So, as an example, if our dataset has 1000 points, and we want 5 nearest neighbors with 95% probability of being in the top 5% of nearest neighbors (or, the top 50 nearest neighbors), we set k = 5, tau = 5, and alpha = 0\&.95\&.
.PP
