Using the contents of arma_config\&.hpp, try to catch the condition where the user has included mlpack with ARMA_64BIT_WORD enabled but mlpack was compiled without ARMA_64BIT_WORD enabled\&. This should help prevent a long, drawn-out debugging process where nobody can figure out why the stack is getting mangled\&.
