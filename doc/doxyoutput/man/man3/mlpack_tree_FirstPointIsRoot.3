.PP 
This class is meant to be used as a choice for the policy class RootPointPolicy of the \fBCoverTree\fP class\&. 

This policy determines which point is used for the root node of the cover tree\&. This particular implementation simply chooses the first point in the dataset as the root\&. A more complex implementation might choose, for instance, the point with least maximum distance to other points (the closest to the 'middle')\&.
