Return the maximum bounding rectangle of the node\&. This method should always return the bound that is used for the decision-making in \fBGetSplitPolicy()\fP\&.

.PP
This method returns SplitRequired if a child of an intermediate node should be split, AssignToFirstTree if the child should be inserted to the first subtree, AssignToSecondTree if the child should be inserted to the second subtree\&. The method makes desicion according to the maximum bounding rectangle of the child, the axis along which the intermediate node is being split and the coordinate at which the node is being split\&.

\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIchild\fP A child of the node that is being split\&. 
.br
\fIaxis\fP The axis along which the node is being split\&.
