Defines the LSHSearch class, which performs an approximate nearest neighbor search for a queries in a query set over a given dataset using Locality-sensitive hashing with 2-stable distributions\&.

The details of this method can be found in the following paper:

Additionally, the class implements Multiprobe LSH, which improves approximation results during the search for approximate nearest neighbors\&. The Multiprobe LSH algorithm was presented in the paper:
