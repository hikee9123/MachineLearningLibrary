This is a specialization of the TreeType class to the \fBSpillTree\fP tree type\&. 

It defines characteristics of the spill tree, and is used to help write tree-independent (but still optimized) tree-based algorithms\&. See \fBmlpack/core/tree/tree_traits\&.hpp\fP for more information\&.

.SS "const bool BinaryTree = true\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
This is always a binary tree\&.

.SS "const bool FirstPointIsCentroid = false\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
There is no guarantee that the first point in a node is its centroid\&.

.SS "const bool HasOverlappingChildren = true\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Each spill tree node has two children which can share points\&. Therefore, children can be overlapping\&.

.PP
Points are not contained at multiple levels of the spill tree\&.

.PP
Points are not rearranged during building of the tree\&.

.PP
Spill trees have duplicated points, so NumDescendants() could count a given point twice\&.
