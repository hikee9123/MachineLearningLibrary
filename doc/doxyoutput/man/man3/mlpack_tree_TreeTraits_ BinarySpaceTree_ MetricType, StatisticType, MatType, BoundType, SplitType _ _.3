This is a specialization of the \fBTreeTraits\fP class to the \fBBinarySpaceTree\fP tree type\&. 

It defines characteristics of the binary space tree, and is used to help write tree-independent (but still optimized) tree-based algorithms\&. See \fBmlpack/core/tree/tree_traits\&.hpp\fP for more information\&.

.PP
This is always a binary tree\&. 
.PP

.SS "const bool FirstPointIsCentroid = false\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
There is no guarantee that the first point in a node is its centroid\&.

.SS "const bool HasDuplicatedPoints = false\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Each binary space tree node doesn't share points with any other node\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 47 of file traits\&.hpp\&.
.SS "const bool HasOverlappingChildren = false\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Each binary space tree node has two children which represent non-overlapping subsets of the space which the node represents\&. Therefore, children are not overlapping\&. 
.PP

.SS "const bool HasSelfChildren = false\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Points are not contained at multiple levels of the binary space tree\&.

.SS "const bool RearrangesDataset = true\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Points are rearranged during building of the tree\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 62 of file traits\&.hpp\&.
.SS "const bool UniqueNumDescendants = true\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Binary space trees don't have duplicated points, so NumDescendants() represents the number of unique descendant points\&.
