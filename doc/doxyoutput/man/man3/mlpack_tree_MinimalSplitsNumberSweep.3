class mlpack::tree::MinimalSplitsNumberSweep< SplitPolicy >"
The \fBMinimalSplitsNumberSweep\fP class finds a partition along which we can split a node according to the number of required splits of the node\&. 

The class finds a partition along a given axis\&. Moreover, the class evaluates the cost of each split\&. The cost is proportional to the number of required splits and the difference of sizes of resulting nodes\&. If the resulting nodes are overflowed the maximum cost is returned\&.
