class cereal::PointerVectorWrapper< T >"
The objective of this class is to create a wrapper for std::vector that hold pointers by adding also the size of the vector\&. 

Cereal supports the serialization of the std vector, but we need to serialize the vector if it holds raw pointer\&. This wrapper uses the \fBPointerWrapper\fP we have already created, it serialize each pointer in the vector independently\&.
.PP
We need to add the size of the vector if it holds a raw pointers, during the serialization, so we can know the size of the number pointer to allocated during the deserialization process\&.
