class mlpack::tree::TreeTraits< BinarySpaceTree< MetricType, StatisticType, MatType, bound::HollowBallBound, SplitType > >"
This is a specialization of the TreeType class to an arbitrary tree with HollowBallBound (currently only the vantage point tree is supported)\&. 

The only difference with general \fBBinarySpaceTree\fP is that the tree can have overlapping children\&.
