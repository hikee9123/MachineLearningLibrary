Definition of the CellBound class\&. The class describes a bound that consists of a number of hyperrectangles\&. These hyperrectangles do not overlap each other\&. The bound is limited by an outer hyperrectangle and two addresses, the lower address and the high address\&. Thus, the bound contains all points included between the lower and the high addresses\&.
.PP
The notion of addresses is described in the following paper\&.
