.PP 
\fBMissingPolicy\fP is used as a helper class for \fBDatasetMapper\fP\&. 

It tells how the strings should be mapped\&. Purpose of this policy is to map all user-defined missing variables into maps so that users can decide what to do with the corrupted data\&. User-defined missing variables are given by the missingSet\&. Note that \fBMissingPolicy\fP does not change type of features\&.

Create the \fBMissingPolicy\fP object with the given missingSet\&. Note that the missingSet cannot be changed later; you will have to create a new \fBMissingPolicy\fP object\&.

.PP
Given the string and the dimension to which it belongs by the user, and the maps and types given by the \fBDatasetMapper\fP class, returns its numeric mapping\&. If no mapping yet exists and the string is included in the missingSet, the string is added to the list of mappings for the given dimension\&. This function is used as a helper function for \fBDatasetMapper\fP class\&.
