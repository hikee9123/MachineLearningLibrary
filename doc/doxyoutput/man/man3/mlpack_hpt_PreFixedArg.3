struct mlpack::hpt::PreFixedArg< T >"
A struct for marking arguments as ones that should be fixed (it can be useful for the Optimize method of \fBHyperParameterTuner\fP)\&. 

Arguments of this type are supposed to be converted into structs of the type \fBFixedArg\fP by adding information about argument positions\&.
.PP
This struct is not meant to be used directly by users\&. Rather use the \fBmlpack::hpt::Fixed\fP function\&.
