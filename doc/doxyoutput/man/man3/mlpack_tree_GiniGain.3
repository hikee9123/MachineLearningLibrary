.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The Gini gain, a measure of set purity usable as a fitness function (FitnessFunction) for decision trees\&. 

This is the exact same thing as the well-known Gini impurity, but negated---since the decision tree will be trying to maximize gain (and the Gini impurity would need to be minimized)\&.

.PP
Evaluate the Gini impurity on the given set of labels\&. RowType should be an Armadillo vector that holds size_t objects\&.
.PP
Note that it is possible that due to floating-point representation issues, it is possible that the gain returned can be very slightly greater than 0! Thus, if you are checking for a perfect fit, be sure to use 'gain >= 0\&.0' not 'gain == 0\&.0'\&.
