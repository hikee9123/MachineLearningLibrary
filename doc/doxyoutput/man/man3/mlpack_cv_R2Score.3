The R2 Score is a metric of performance for regression algorithms that represents the proportion of variance (here y) that has been explained by the independent variables in the model\&. 

It provides an indication of goodness of fit and therefore a measure of how well unseen samples are likely to be predicted by the model, through the proportion of explained variance\&. As R2 Score is dataset dependent it can have wide range of values\&. The best possible score is $R^2 =1.0$\&. Values of R2 outside the range 0 to 1 can occur when the model fits the data worse than a horizontal hyperplane\&. This would occur when the wrong model was chosen, or nonsensical constraints were applied by mistake\&. A model which predicts exactly the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, gets a R2 Score equals to 0\&.0\&. If a model predicts $ \hat{y}_i $ of the $ i $-th sample for a true $ y_i $ for total n samples, the R2 Score is calculated by \begin{eqnarray*} R^{2} \left( y, \hat{y} \right) &=& 1-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_i - \hat{y_i} \right)^2 } {\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_i - \bar{y}\right)^2}\\ \end{eqnarray*}
.PP
where $ \bar{y} = frac{1}{y}\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i $\&. For example, a model having \fBR2Score\fP = 0\&.85, explains 85 % variability of the response data around its mean\&.
