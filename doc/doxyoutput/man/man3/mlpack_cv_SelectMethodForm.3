struct mlpack::cv::SelectMethodForm< MLAlgorithm, HMFs >"
A type function that selects a right method form\&. 

As parameters it takes a machine learning algorithm, a set of HasMethodForm structs, and a set of method forms\&. Method forms are passed to the internal struct From\&. The result type can be accessed through the Type member of the From struct\&.
.PP
The implementation basically loops through all combinations of the HasMethodForm structs and the method forms\&. It stops when a right combination succeeds, or when there are no more combinations\&.
