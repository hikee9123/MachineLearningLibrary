This is a model for nearest or furthest neighbor search\&. It is useful in that it provides an easy way to serialize a model, abstracts away the different types of trees, and also (roughly) reflects the NeighborSearch API and automatically directs to the right tree type\&. It is meant to be used by the knn and kfn bindings\&.
