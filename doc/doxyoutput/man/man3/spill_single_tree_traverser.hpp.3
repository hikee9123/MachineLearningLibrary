A nested class of SpillTree which traverses the entire tree with a given set of rules which indicate the branches which can be pruned and the order in which to recurse\&. This traverser is a depth-first traverser\&. The Defeatist template parameter determines if the traversers must do defeatist search on overlapping nodes\&.
