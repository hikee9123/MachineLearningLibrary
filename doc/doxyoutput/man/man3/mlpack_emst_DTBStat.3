.SS "\fBDTBStat\fP ()\fC [inline]\fP"

.PP
A generic initializer\&. Sets the maximum neighbor distance to its default, and the component membership to -1 (no component)\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 49 of file dtb_stat\&.hpp\&.
.SS "\fBDTBStat\fP (const TreeType & node)\fC [inline]\fP"

.PP
This is called when a node is finished initializing\&. We set the maximum neighbor distance to its default, and if possible, we set the component membership of the node (if it has only one point and no children)\&.
