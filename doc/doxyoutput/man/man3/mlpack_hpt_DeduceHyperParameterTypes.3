struct mlpack::hpt::DeduceHyperParameterTypes< Args >"
A type function for deducing types of hyper-parameters from types of arguments in the Optimize method in \fBHyperParameterTuner\fP\&. 

We start by putting all types of the arguments into Args, and then process each of them one by one and put results into the internal struct \fBResultHolder\fP\&. By the end Args become empty, while \fBResultHolder\fP holds the tuple type of hyper-parameters\&.
.PP
Here we declare and define \fBDeduceHyperParameterTypes\fP for the end phase when Args are empty (all argument types have been processed)\&.
