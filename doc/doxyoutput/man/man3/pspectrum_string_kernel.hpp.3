Implementation of the p-spectrum string kernel, created for use with FastMKS\&. Instead of passing a data matrix to FastMKS which stores the kernels, pass a one-dimensional data matrix (data vector) to FastMKS which stores indices of strings; then, the actual strings are given to the PSpectrumStringKernel at construction time, and the kernel knows to map the indices to actual strings\&.
