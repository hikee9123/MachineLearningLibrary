Structs for initializing and training HMMs (either of Discrete, Gaussian, GMM, or Diagonal GMM HMMs)\&. These structs are passed as template parameters to the PerformAction function of an HMMModel object\&. These structs have been adapted from the structs in mlpack/methods/hmm/hmm_train_main\&.cpp\&.
