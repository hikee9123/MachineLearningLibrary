class \textbf{ Dropout$<$ Input\+Data\+Type, Output\+Data\+Type $>$}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The dropout layer is a regularizer that randomly with probability \textquotesingle{}ratio\textquotesingle{} sets input values to zero and scales the remaining elements by factor 1 / (1 -\/ ratio) rather than during test time so as to keep the expected sum same. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
