         selection\},

This algorithm, called Drusilla\+Select, constructs a candidate set of points to query to find an approximate furthest neighbor. The strange name is a result of the algorithm being named after a cat. The cat in question may be viewed at {\tt http\+://www.\+ratml.\+org/misc\+\_\+img/drusilla\+\_\+fence.\+png}.
