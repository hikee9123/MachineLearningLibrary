\subsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$typename Metric\+Type = metric\+::\+L\+Metric$<$2, true$>$, typename Elem\+Type = double$>$\newline
class mlpack\+::bound\+::\+Cell\+Bound$<$ Metric\+Type, Elem\+Type $>$}

The \doxyref{Cell\+Bound}{p.}{classmlpack_1_1bound_1_1CellBound} class describes a bound that consists of a number of hyperrectangles. 

These hyperrectangles do not overlap each other. The bound is limited by an outer hyperrectangle and two addresses, the lower address and the high address. Thus, the bound contains all points included between the lower and the high addresses. The class caches the minimum bounding rectangle, the lower and the high addresses and the hyperrectangles that are described by the addresses.

The notion of addresses is described in the following paper.
