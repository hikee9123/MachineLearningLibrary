\subsection{Detailed Description}

Defines the L\+S\+H\+Search class, which performs an approximate nearest neighbor search for a queries in a query set over a given dataset using Locality-\/sensitive hashing with 2-\/stable distributions.

The details of this method can be found in the following paper\+:

 title=\{Locality-sensitive hashing scheme based on p-stable distributions\},

     \{Proceedings of the 12th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry\},
 pages=\{253--262\},
 year=\{2004\},
 organization=\{ACM\}
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


Additionally, the class implements Multiprobe L\+SH, which improves approximation results during the search for approximate nearest neighbors. The Multiprobe L\+SH algorithm was presented in the paper\+:
