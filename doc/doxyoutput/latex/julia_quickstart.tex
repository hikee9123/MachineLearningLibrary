\section{Introduction}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_intro}
This page describes how you can quickly get started using mlpack from Julia and gives a few examples of usage, and pointers to deeper documentation.

This quickstart guide is also available for \doxyref{Python}{p.}{python_quickstart}, \doxyref{the command-\/line}{p.}{cli_quickstart}, \doxyref{Go}{p.}{go_quickstart} and \doxyref{R}{p.}{r_quickstart}.\section{Installing mlpack}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_install}
Installing the mlpack bindings for Julia is straightforward; you can just use {\ttfamily Pkg\+:} 


\begin{DoxyCode}
using Pkg
Pkg.add("mlpack")
\end{DoxyCode}


Building the Julia bindings from scratch is a little more in-\/depth, though. For information on that, follow the instructions on the \doxyref{Building mlpack From Source}{p.}{build} page, and be sure to specify {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+J\+U\+L\+I\+A\+\_\+\+B\+I\+N\+D\+I\+N\+GS=ON} to C\+Make; you may need to also set the location of the Julia program with {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+J\+U\+L\+I\+A\+\_\+\+E\+X\+E\+C\+U\+T\+A\+B\+LE=/path/to/julia}.\section{Simple mlpack quickstart example}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_example}
As a really simple example of how to use mlpack from Julia, let\textquotesingle{}s do some simple classification on a subset of the standard machine learning {\ttfamily covertype} dataset. We\textquotesingle{}ll first split the dataset into a training set and a testing set, then we\textquotesingle{}ll train an mlpack random forest on the training data, and finally we\textquotesingle{}ll print the accuracy of the random forest on the test dataset.

You can copy-\/paste this code directly into Julia to run it. You may need to add some extra packages with, e.\+g., {\ttfamily using Pkg; Pkg.\+add(\char`\"{}\+C\+S\+V\char`\"{}); Pkg.\+add(\char`\"{}\+Data\+Frames\char`\"{}); Pkg.\+add(\char`\"{}\+Libz\char`\"{})}.


\begin{DoxyCode}
using CSV
using DataFrames
using Libz
using mlpack

# Load the dataset from an online URL.  Replace with 'covertype.csv.gz' if you
# want to use on the full dataset.
df = CSV.read(ZlibInflateInputStream(open(download(
        "http://www.mlpack.org/datasets/covertype-small.csv.gz"))))

# Split the labels.
labels = df[!, :label][:]
dataset = select!(df, Not(:label))

# Split the dataset using mlpack.
test, test\_labels, train, train\_labels = mlpack.preprocess\_split(
    dataset,
    input\_labels=labels,
    test\_ratio=0.3)

# Train a random forest.
rf\_model, \_, \_ = mlpack.random\_forest(training=train,
                              labels=train\_labels,
                              print\_training\_accuracy=true,
                              num\_trees=10,
                              minimum\_leaf\_size=3)

# Predict the labels of the test points.
\_, predictions, \_ = mlpack.random\_forest(input\_model=rf\_model,
                                         test=test)

# Now print the accuracy.  The third return value ('probabilities'), which we
# ignored here, could also be used to generate an ROC curve.
correct = sum(predictions .== test\_labels)
print("$(correct) out of $(length(test\_labels)) test points correct " *
    "($(correct / length(test\_labels) * 100.0)%).\(\backslash\)n")
\end{DoxyCode}


We can see that we achieve reasonably good accuracy on the test dataset (80\%+); if we use the full {\ttfamily covertype.\+csv.\+gz}, the accuracy should increase significantly (but training will take longer).

It\textquotesingle{}s easy to modify the code above to do more complex things, or to use different mlpack learners, or to interface with other machine learning toolkits.\section{What else does mlpack implement?}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_whatelse}
The example above has only shown a little bit of the functionality of mlpack. Lots of other commands are available with different functionality. A full list of each of these commands and full documentation can be found on the following page\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\tt Julia documentation}
\end{DoxyItemize}

You can also use the Julia R\+E\+PL to explore the {\ttfamily mlpack} module and its functions; every function comes with comprehensive documentation.

For more information on what mlpack does, see {\tt https\+://www.\+mlpack.\+org/}. Next, let\textquotesingle{}s go through another example for providing movie recommendations with mlpack.\section{Using mlpack for movie recommendations}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_movierecs}
In this example, we\textquotesingle{}ll train a collaborative filtering model using mlpack\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily {\tt cf()}} method. We\textquotesingle{}ll train this on the Movie\+Lens dataset from {\tt https\+://grouplens.\+org/datasets/movielens/,} and then we\textquotesingle{}ll use the model that we train to give recommendations.

You can copy-\/paste this code directly into Julia to run it.


\begin{DoxyCode}
using CSV
using mlpack
using Libz
using DataFrames

# Load the dataset from an online URL.  Replace with 'covertype.csv.gz' if you
# want to use on the full dataset.
ratings = CSV.read(ZlibInflateInputStream(open(download(
        "http://www.mlpack.org/datasets/ml-20m/ratings-only.csv.gz"))))
movies = CSV.read(ZlibInflateInputStream(open(download(
        "http://www.mlpack.org/datasets/ml-20m/movies.csv.gz"))))

# Hold out 10% of the dataset into a test set so we can evaluate performance.
ratings\_test, \_, ratings\_train, \_ = mlpack.preprocess\_split(ratings;
    test\_ratio=0.1, verbose=true)

# Train the model.  Change the rank to increase/decrease the complexity of the
# model.
\_, cf\_model = mlpack.cf(training=ratings\_train,
                        test=ratings\_test,
                        rank=10,
                        verbose=true,
                        algorithm="RegSVD")

# Now query the 5 top movies for user 1.
output, \_ = mlpack.cf(input\_model=cf\_model,
                      query=[1],
                      recommendations=10,
                      verbose=true,
                      max\_iterations=10)

print("Recommendations for user 1:\(\backslash\)n")
for i in 1:10
  print("  $(i): $(movies[output[i], :][3])\(\backslash\)n")
end
\end{DoxyCode}


Here is some example output, showing that user 1 seems to have good taste in movies\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
Recommendations for user 1:
  0: Casablanca (1942)
  1: Pan's Labyrinth (Laberinto del fauno, El) (2006)
  2: Godfather, The (1972)
  3: Answer This! (2010)
  4: Life Is Beautiful (La Vita Ã¨ bella) (1997)
  5: Adventures of Tintin, The (2011)
  6: Dark Knight, The (2008)
  7: Out for Justice (1991)
  8: Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)
  9: Schindler's List (1993)
\end{DoxyCode}
\section{Next steps with mlpack}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_nextsteps}
Now that you have done some simple work with mlpack, you have seen how it can easily plug into a data science workflow in Julia. A great thing to do next would be to look at more documentation for the Julia mlpack bindings\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\tt Julia mlpack binding documentation}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also, mlpack is much more flexible from C++ and allows much greater functionality. So, more complicated tasks are possible if you are willing to write C++ (or perhaps Cxx\+Wrap.\+jl). To get started learning about mlpack in C++, the following resources might be helpful\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\tt mlpack C++ tutorials}
\item {\tt mlpack build and installation guide}
\item {\tt Simple sample C++ mlpack programs}
\item {\tt mlpack Doxygen documentation homepage}
