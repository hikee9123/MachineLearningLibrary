This directory contains code and data used to test all the algorithms and functions implemented in mlpack.

\subsection*{Test Directories Structure}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $\ast$\+\_\+test.cpp -\/ methods tests
\item main\+\_\+tests/$\ast$\+\_\+test.cpp -\/ binding tests
\item data -\/ data needed to run the tests
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Add tests}

We have a rich test suite, consisting of almost 2000 tests (and still counting). It is suggested to add tests when\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Adding new functionality.
\item Fixing regressions and bugs.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Building Tests}

To build the test suite you can simply run {\ttfamily make mlpack\+\_\+test}.

\subsection*{To run Tests}

We use {\ttfamily Catch2} to write our tests. To run all tests, you can simply run\+:

{\ttfamily ./bin/mlpack\+\_\+test}

To run all tests in a particular file you can run\+:

{\ttfamily ./bin/mlpack\+\_\+test \char`\"{}[testname]\char`\"{}}

where {\ttfamily testname} is the name of the test suite. For example to run all collaborative filtering tests implemented in {\ttfamily cv\+\_\+test.\+cpp} you can run\+:

{\ttfamily ./bin/mlpack\+\_\+test \char`\"{}[\+C\+V\+Test]\char`\"{}}

Now similarly you can run all the binding related tests using\+:

{\ttfamily ./bin/mlpack\+\_\+test \char`\"{}[\+Binding\+Tests]\char`\"{}}

To run a single test, you can explicitly provide the name of the test, for example, to run {\ttfamily Binary\+Classification\+Metrics\+Test} implemented in {\ttfamily cv\+\_\+test.\+cpp} you can run the following\+:

{\ttfamily ./bin/mlpack\+\_\+test Binary\+Classification\+Metrics\+Test}

Catch2 provides many other features like filter, checkout the {\tt Catch2 reference section} -\/ for more details.
