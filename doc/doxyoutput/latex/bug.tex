Class \doxyref{IO}{p.}{classmlpack_1_1IO} ]The {\bfseries C\+O\+U\+N\+T\+ER} variable is used in most cases to guarantee a unique global identifier for options declared using the P\+A\+R\+A\+M\+\_\+$\ast$() macros. However, not all compilers have this support--most notably, gcc $<$ 4.\+3. In that case, the {\bfseries L\+I\+NE} macro is used as an attempt to get a unique global identifier, but collisions are still possible, and they produce bizarre error messages. See {\tt https\+://github.\+com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/100} for more information.
