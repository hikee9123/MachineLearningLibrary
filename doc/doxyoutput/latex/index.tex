\section{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
mlpack is an intuitive, fast, and flexible C++ machine learning library with bindings to other languages. It is meant to be a machine learning analog to L\+A\+P\+A\+CK, and aims to implement a wide array of machine learning methods and function as a \char`\"{}swiss army knife\char`\"{} for machine learning researchers. The mlpack website can be found at {\tt https\+://mlpack.\+org}.\section{How To Use This Documentation}\label{index_howto}
This documentation is A\+PI documentation similar to Javadoc. It isn\textquotesingle{}t necessarily a tutorial, but it does provide detailed documentation on every namespace, method, and class.

Each mlpack namespace generally refers to one machine learning method, so browsing the list of namespaces provides some insight as to the breadth of the methods contained in the library.

To generate this documentation in your own local copy of mlpack, you can use the \textquotesingle{}doc\textquotesingle{} C\+Make target, which is available if C\+Make has found Doxygen, from the build directory\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ make doc
\end{DoxyCode}
