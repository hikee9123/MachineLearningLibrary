The Windows installer is generated by [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), which is a free installer for Windows programs.

Most of the content in this script is about the location of files, which should be changed according to your building system.

You can also use the GUI setup wizard to set all the file locations. There are just two lines to be added after that.

* In `[Setup]` block, please add the line below, since we need to set `PATH` to where mlpack installed

```
ChangesEnvironment=yes
```

* In `[Registry]` block, please use the line below to set `PATH`

```
Root: HKLM; Subkey: "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment"; ValueType: expandsz; ValueName: "Path"; ValueData: "{olddata};{app}"
```


**NOTE:** The value of AppId uniquely identifies this application. **Do not use the same AppId value** in installers for other applications.
